# Hepatitis-C-Detection
The project involves analysis of the Hepatitis C dataset. 
The data set contains laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients and demographic values like age. The data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HCV+data

The target attribute for classification is Category (5): blood donors, suspect Blood Donor, Hepatitis C, Fibrosis, Cirrhosis.

This project involves implementation of various models with different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Classifier, GridSearchCV in Python. This project diagnosis the hepatitis C disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features a a variety of parameters, and the target variable is a multiclass variable with 5 different classes.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

  1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
  2. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
  3. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
  4. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
  5. Gradient Boosting Classifier (Scikit-learn)
  6. GridSearchCV (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy achieved: 93.9% (GridSearchCV Random Forest)
